  "body": "BigReactors CE\r\n===========\r\n\r\nWhat is this?\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nAn upcoming mod for Minecraft, based on adding new and fun ways to generate power through big multi-block structures. Don't just plop blocks, design the machines yourself!\r\n\r\nFor near-future plans and development status, see the Roadmap file.\r\n\r\nBig Reactors has an official website at [www.big-reactors.com](http://www.big-reactors.com)\r\n\r\nAlpha\r\n--------\r\n\r\nBig Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no _known_ serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest alpha from [the big-reactors.com download page](http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download).\r\n\r\n_You will need other mods_ to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend [Thermal Expansion](http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nLicensing for Minecraft mods is silly. If you want to use my mod on your server, in your modpack, whatever, do it, have fun! If you want to use, copy or fork my code, go for it, have fun!\r\n\r\nFor the pedantic, copied from LICENSE.txt:\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013, 2014 \"Erogenous Beef\"\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\r\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
