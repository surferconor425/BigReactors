<h2>
<a id="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h2>

<p>An upcoming mod for Minecraft, based on adding new and fun ways to generate power through big multi-block structures. Don't just plop blocks, design the machines yourself!</p>

<p>For near-future plans and development status, see the Roadmap file.</p>

<p>Big Reactors has an official website at <a href="http://www.big-reactors.com">www.big-reactors.com</a></p>

<h2>
<a id="alpha" class="anchor" href="#alpha" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alpha</h2>

<p>Big Reactors is in an alpha state. The major features exist, and there are no <em>known</em> serious bugs. However, it's not fully balanced. I'm only one guy - I can't totally break all the combinations you crazy folks will discover. The internal radiation/power production simulation is very complicated.</p>

<p>You can download the latest alpha from <a href="http://www.big-reactors.com/#/download">the big-reactors.com download page</a>.</p>

<p><em>You will need other mods</em> to play with Big Reactors. This is just a power-generation mod, so you will need a mod that supports the Redstone Flux (RF) power system. I personally recommend <a href="http://teamcofh.com/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>.</p>

<a id="license" class="anchor" href="#license" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>License</h2>

<p>Licensing for Minecraft mods is silly. If you want to use my mod on your server, in your modpack, whatever, do it, have fun! If you want to use, copy or fork my code, go for it, have fun!</p>
